## *Lassa mammarenavirus* assay development

Diagnostics for Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) are challenging due to the variability in viral sequence and structure. Several commercial PCR and antibody kits are available. To our knowledge there no pan-species antibody assays. To support our ongoing work on understanding the epidemiology and transmission dynamics in multi-species systems in endemic regions we have begun developing a cross-species assay. We adopted an approach that has been found to be successful for *Peste des petits ruminants* a virus that affects goats, sheep and camels and is targeted for eradication. These assays are built on the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System [@berguido_specific_2016] which detect the presence of antibodies against the presented antigen.

Our work so far in the development of the assay is presented in the following posts:
