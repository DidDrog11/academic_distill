My work is organised into three themes:

  1. Lassa fever, including assay development, epidemiology and rodent ecology
  2. Research on COVID-19, specifically the interaction between cigarette smoking and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection, severity and mortality
  3. A one health approach to antimicrobial resistance particularly within the poultry industry
