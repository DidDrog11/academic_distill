## COVID-19 transmission and control strategies

The COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the potential impact from emerging zoonotic infectious diseases. During the early stages of the pandemic I supported CMMID at LSHTM with their data management pipeline and was a member of the COVID-19 working group. As case numbers in the UK increased after the summer I reduced my role in the academic response to increase the amount of time I could contribute to the clinical response.

## COVID-19 and the association with smoking

Since March 2020 I have also been involved in some work investigating the association of smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 severity and mortality. This work has been led by [Olga Perski](www.olgaperski.com) and colleagues at [UCL-Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/epidemiology-health-care/research/behavioural-science-and-health/research/ucl-tobacco-alcohol-research-group-utarg).

Current and former smoking is associated with worse outcomes and increased rates of hospitalisation from respiratory infections such as Respiratory Synciatial Virus, Influenza viruses and bacterial infections. Because of this there was an early concern about how the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 may interact with smoking.

Early data released from healthcare services in China in the early parts of 2020 suggested that smoking was not a significant risk factor for COVID-19 disease. Whether this was a true effect or reflected poor recording or reporting was unclear. We began to synthesise the published and pre-print literature to investigate the specific association of smoking and COVID-19. This was initially performed as a report for the Royal College of Physicians, London and was expanded following a request from Public Health England.

## Other work

Another group that were potentially at greater risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 infection were individuals suffering with Sickle Cell Disease. We wrote a commentary piece to draw attention to this group of individuals who are more prevalent in sub-Saharan countries in Africa that also suffer from a further burden of often under-developed healthcare infrastructure [@dexter_mitigating_2020]

Along with colleagues from the PANDORA network we tried to identify the countries that could be at greatest risk of importation of cases early in the epidemic based off flight data [@haider_passengers_2020]
