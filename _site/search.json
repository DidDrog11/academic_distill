I use systems\n            approaches to understand the interaction between human and\n            biological factors on these risks.\n            My PhD research is predominantly focused in Sierra Leone,\n            West Africa with Lassa\n            fever, Monkeypox\n            and Ebola as\n            model disease systems. I adopt interdisciplinary approaches\n            using methods from clinical medicine, epidemiology,\n            mathematical modelling and systems biology. I am a member of\n            the PANDORA-ID-net\n            consortium and work closely with collaborators on the One\n            Health theme. My\n            field work is conducted with colleagues based at Njala\n            University in Sierra Leone. With this work I aim to develop\n            dynamic models of disease risk and translate these into\n            policy implementations to promote the health and wellbeing\n            of human communities in low resource settings within a\n            planetary health framework.

I was based in the Outbreak\n            Surveillance Team starting shortly before the beginning of\n            the Omicron variant importation and spread. During this\n            period I was responsible for producing an automated approach\n            to monitoring real time reported cases exploring spatial\n            spread and informing contact tracing and the initial public\n            health response.

This work has been led by Olga Perski and colleagues at UCL-Tobacco\nand Alcohol Research Group.\nCurrent and former smoking is associated with worse outcomes and\nincreased rates of hospitalisation from respiratory infections such as\nRespiratory Synciatial Virus, Influenza viruses and bacterial\ninfections. Because of this there was an early concern about how the\npandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 may interact with smoking.\nEarly data released from healthcare services in China in the early\nparts of 2020 suggested that smoking was not a significant risk factor\nfor COVID-19 disease. Whether this was a true effect or reflected poor\nrecording or reporting was unclear. We began to synthesise the published\nand pre-print literature to investigate the specific association of\nsmoking and COVID-19. This was initially performed as a report for the\nRoyal College of Physicians, London and was expanded following a request\nfrom Public Health England.\nCOVID-19\nand smoking living evidence review\nThe\nassociation of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Quit for COVID\n\n\n\nRisk\nof COVID-19 in individuals with Sickle Cell Disease\nAnother group that were potentially at greater risk of adverse\noutcomes from COVID-19 infection were individuals suffering with Sickle\nCell Disease.

Human exposure hinges significantly on LASV ecology,\nwhich is in turn shaped by various parameters such as weather\nseasonality and even virus and rodent-host genetics. Furthermore, human\nbehaviour, despite playing a key role in the zoonotic nature of the\ndisease, critically affects either the spread or control of\nhuman-to-human transmission. Previous estimations on LF burden date from\nthe 80s and it is unclear how the population expansion and the\nimprovement on diagnostics and surveillance methods have affected such\npredictions. Although recent data have contributed to the awareness of\nepidemics, the real impact of LF in West African communities will only\nbe possible with the intensification of interdisciplinary efforts in\nresearch and public health approaches. This review discusses the causes\nand consequences of LF from a One Health perspective, and how the\napplication of this concept can improve the surveillance and control of\nthis disease in West Africa.\nLink\nto publication\n\nCOVID-19\nCOVID-19\ntransmission and control strategies\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the potential impact from\nemerging zoonotic infectious diseases. During the early stages of the\npandemic I supported CMMID at LSHTM with their data management pipeline\nand was a member of the COVID-19 working group. As case numbers in the\nUK increased after the summer I reduced my role in the epidemiological\nand modelling work to increase the amount of time I could contribute to\nthe clinical response.\nCMMID website\nwith a list of the outputs from the working group\nASMODEE\nan ongoing COVID-19 surveillance activity I remain involved in\nCOVID-19 and the\nassociation with smoking\nSince March 2020 I have also been involved in a project investigating\nthe association of smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19\nseverity and mortality. This work has been led by Olga Perski and colleagues at UCL-Tobacco\nand Alcohol Research Group.\nCurrent and former smoking is associated with worse outcomes and\nincreased rates of hospitalisation from respiratory infections such as\nRespiratory Synciatial Virus, Influenza viruses and bacterial\ninfections. Because of this there was an early concern about how the\npandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 may interact with smoking.\nEarly data released from healthcare services in China in the early\nparts of 2020 suggested that smoking was not a significant risk factor\nfor COVID-19 disease. Whether this was a true effect or reflected poor\nrecording or reporting was unclear. We began to synthesise the published\nand pre-print literature to investigate the specific association of\nsmoking and COVID-19.

The\nfirst, investigating Monkeypox community transmission following\nintroduction into the UK identified as three separate incidents.\nCommunity transmission of\nMonkeypox\nMonkeypox is a re-emerging zoonotic infection caused by monkeypox\nvirus (MPXV). In the past case detection has been primarily detected in\nWest and Central Africa. The incubation period of monkeypox can be up to\n21 days. In the United Kingdom (UK) all previous seven cases ever\nreported were either imported, or household or healthcare contacts of\nimported cases. In this report, we described an ongoing outbreak of MPXV\ninfections in the UK, detected since the beginning of May 2022 affecting\npeople without documented history of travel to endemic countries (Vivancos et al.\n2022). This work has been published in Eurosurveillance.\nCurrent\nresearch gaps in understanding Monkeypox spillover\nIn this work we explored the research gaps on Monkeypox (MPX) virus\nepidemiology in endemic countries. We presented hypotheses for the\nrecent increase of MPX cases in West Africa as a possible explanation\nfor the current outbreak of internationally distributed cases. First,\nthat the true burden of MPX in West and Central Africa is poorly\nunderstood. Second, that the diversity and extent of the animal\nreservoir remains unknown. We hypothesised that the changing\nhuman-rodent interaction rates in recent years may facilitate increased\ntransmission of MPXV in endemic settings. We further hypothesised that\nfollowing the end of routine smallpox vaccination, the larger and more\ninterconnected immune-naïve population has crossed a threshold resulting\nin more sustainable human-to-human transmission of MPXV. We call for\nlocal led research efforts on the estimation of the basic and effective\nreproduction rate (R0 and Re) in different populations is required (Haider et al.,\nn.d.).

In the past case detection has been primarily detected in\nWest and Central Africa. The incubation period of monkeypox can be up to\n21 days. In the United Kingdom (UK) all previous seven cases ever\nreported were either imported, or household or healthcare contacts of\nimported cases. In this report, we described an ongoing outbreak of MPXV\ninfections in the UK, detected since the beginning of May 2022 affecting\npeople without documented history of travel to endemic countries (Vivancos et al.\n2022). This work has been published in Eurosurveillance.\nCurrent\nresearch gaps in understanding Monkeypox spillover\nIn this work we explored the research gaps on Monkeypox (MPX) virus\nepidemiology in endemic countries. We presented hypotheses for the\nrecent increase of MPX cases in West Africa as a possible explanation\nfor the current outbreak of internationally distributed cases. First,\nthat the true burden of MPX in West and Central Africa is poorly\nunderstood. Second, that the diversity and extent of the animal\nreservoir remains unknown. We hypothesised that the changing\nhuman-rodent interaction rates in recent years may facilitate increased\ntransmission of MPXV in endemic settings. We further hypothesised that\nfollowing the end of routine smallpox vaccination, the larger and more\ninterconnected immune-naïve population has crossed a threshold resulting\nin more sustainable human-to-human transmission of MPXV. We call for\nlocal led research efforts on the estimation of the basic and effective\nreproduction rate (R0 and Re) in different populations is required (Haider et al.,\nn.d.).
