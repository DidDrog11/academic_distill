I am funded through a BBSRC PhD studentship with the LIDo DTP. I am supervised by an interdisciplinary team of researchers, Prof. Richard Kock (RVC), Prof. Deborah Watson-Jones (LSHTM), and Prof. Kate Jones (UCL). My research interests fit within the developing field of Planetary Health One Health with a particular focus on the effect of anthropogenic change on the risks of zoonotic infectious disease emergence and subsequent spread. I use systems approaches to understand the interaction between human and biological factors on disease risk.\r\n            My PhD research is predominantly focused on West Africa with Lassa fever, Monkeypox and Ebola as model disease systems. I adopt interdisciplinary approaches using methods from clinical medicine, epidemiology, mathematical modelling and systems biology. I am a member of the PANDORA-ID-net consortium and work closely with collaborators on the One Health theme. My field work is conducted with colleagues based at Njala University in Sierra Leone. With this work I aim to develop dynamic models of disease risk and translate these into policy implementations to promote the health and wellbeing of human communities in low resource settings within a planetary health framework. I am also interested in the area of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), another topic benefiting from a One Health approach.\r\n            I am a proponent of Open Science with pre-specified research questions and study protocols posted to the Open Science Framework. I am developing my programming skills and will continue to try and make all code used for my analyses available in reproducible files hosted on my GitHub page. All data where possible will be hosted on open data repositories and will be linked to the projects contained within this website.\r\n            I continue to practice as a clinician with the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and within the emergency department at University College London Hospital. Alongside my clinical work during the COVID-19 pandemic I have contributed to the work of LSHTM’s Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases to understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and potential control measures.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Education\r\n            The Royal Veterinary College | London, UK\r\n            PhD in Epidemiology of Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases | Sep 2019 - Ongoing\r\n            The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine | London, UK\r\n            MSc in Tropical Medicine and International Health | Sep 2018 - Sep 2019\r\n            The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine | London, UK\r\n            DTM&H Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | Sep 2018 - Dec 2018\r\n            Guy’s, King’s and St. Thomas’ Medical School, King’s College London | London, UK\r\n            MBBS in Medicine and Surgery | Sep 2012 - Sep 2016\r\n            University of Leeds | Leeds, UK\r\n            MSc in Biodiversity and Conservation | Sep 2010 - Sep 2011\r\n            University of Leeds | Leeds, UK\r\n            BSc in Natural Sciences w/ Industrial Placement | Sep 2006 -Sep 2010\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              David Simons\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      ORCID\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Twitter\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Google Scholar\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      C.V.\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              Bio\r\n              I am a current PhD student based in the Centre for Emerging, Endemic and Exotic diseases at the Royal Veterinary College, London.

Several commercial PCR and antibody kits are available. To our knowledge there no pan-species antibody assays. To support our ongoing work on understanding the epidemiology and transmission dynamics in multi-species systems in endemic regions we have begun developing a cross-species assay. We adopted an approach that has been found to be successful for Peste des petits ruminants a virus that affects goats, sheep and camels and is targeted for eradication. These assays are built on the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (Berguido et al. 2016) which detect the presence of antibodies against the presented antigen.\r\nOur work so far in the development of the assay is presented in the following posts:\r\nIdentification of potential antigenic epitopes\r\nRodent trapping\r\n\r\nCOVID-19\r\nCOVID-19 transmission and control strategies\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the potential impact from emerging zoonotic infectious diseases.

Several commercial PCR and antibody kits are available. To our knowledge there no pan-species antibody assays. To support our ongoing work on understanding the epidemiology and transmission dynamics in multi-species systems in endemic regions we have begun developing a cross-species assay. We adopted an approach that has been found to be successful for Peste des petits ruminants a virus that affects goats, sheep and camels and is targeted for eradication. These assays are built on the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (Berguido et al. 2016) which detect the presence of antibodies against the presented antigen.\r\nOur work so far in the development of the assay is presented in the following posts:\r\nIdentification of potential antigenic epitopes\r\nRodent trapping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBerguido, Francisco J., Sanne Charles Bodjo, Angelika Loitsch, and Adama Diallo. 2016. “Specific Detection of Peste Des Petits Ruminants Virus Antibodies in Sheep and Goat Sera by the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System.” Journal of Virological Methods 227 (January): 40–46. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.10.008.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
