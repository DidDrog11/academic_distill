We adopted an approach that has been found to be successful for Peste des petits ruminants a virus that affects goats, sheep and camels and is targeted for eradication. These assays are built on the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (Berguido et al. 2016) which detect the presence of antibodies against the presented antigen.\r\nFigure 1 shows a schematic approach to the LIPS assay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: LIPS assay CC-BY-NC B.

This data has been used to support study site selection.\r\nPreviously documented Lassa cases in Sierra LeoneThis highlights that most of the documented cases of Lassa Fever in Sierra Leone are found in the East of the country. There is a particularly large cluster around Kenema, the location of the Lassa Fever treatment ward and reference laboratory. There is a slightly smaller cluster to the North and North East of the city around Panguma and Segbwema. recently cases have been detected near Freetown and Bo suggesting a wider distribution. Several projects over the last couple of years, PREDICTS and LAROCS have been conducting larger transect studies across the country which while not formally reported are suggestive of widespread serological evidence of infection in rodents.\r\nMy work will be focussed primarily around Panguma, I will set up a “control” site in Kambia and I would also like to set up an additional semi-urban site on the outskirts of either Panguma or Kenema to complement the two rural sites I will describe below.\r\n The above map highlights human cases and positive rodents in and around Panguma. This in combination with land use maps was used to select the two rural sites. Lalehun lies to the East of Panguma. Seilama lies to the South West. Both are represented by a black diamond.\r\nLand use at the study sites\r\nTo address the above questions it’s important to sample rodents in several distinct habitats. If these habitats undergo changed use during the observed study period this would provide additional causal evidence for any changes in rodent assemblage species composition. However, this is not a specific requirement for this work. Observed differences between species composition across different land usages remains illustrative.\r\nThis land use classification is obtained from a recent paper by Jung et al. 2020. The colours represent different IUCN habitat classifications\r\nBlack = 14.5 Urban Areas\r\nOrange = 3.6 Shrubland - Subtropical-tropical moist\r\nRed = 14.3 Plantations\r\nLight green = 1.6 Forest - subtropical-tropical moist lowland\r\nDark green = 1.9 Forest - subtropical-tropical moist montane\r\nMauve = 3.7 Shrubland - subtropical-tropical high altitude\r\nLalehun land use map, classified by IUCN categoriesSeilama land use map, classified by IUCN categoriesUsing the habitat map and discussions with locals we identified sites that would provide use with varied habitats and that would also be able to be repeatedly sampled irrespective of whether the visit was conducted during the rainy season.\r\nLalehun (Village 1) trap grid locations\r\n The base map used here is from Google maps and so is unfortunately not entirely up-to-date.\r\nThe habitats of the trap grids are as follows:\r\n1 - Village periphery\r\n2 - Proximal agriculture (wet rice field)\r\n3a - Developing Banana plantation and fallow land\r\n3b - Developing Banana plantation and Pineapple garden\r\n4 - Disturbed forest, long-term (5 years) fallow land\r\n5 - Cassava plantation\r\n6 - Within the village, outside of houses\r\nThe specific location of each individual trap was also recorded (e.g. edge environment, base of tree)\r\nSeilama (Village 1) trap grid locations\r\n The habitats of the trap grids are as follows:\r\n1 - Palm plantation, near the village and main road\r\n2 - Proximal agriculture (Cacao and Coffee plantation)\r\n3 - Recently harvested dry rice field\r\n4 - Cassava plantation\r\n5 - Disturbed forest, long term fallow\r\n6 - Within the village, outside of houses\r\nThis effectively produces 1 trap site in the village, 3 proximal agricultural sites, 1 distal agriculture and 1 forest/fallow land site for each village site.\r\nThe code to produce the maps of trap location is in scripts/geolocation_traps.R with the data available in data/trap_sites.csv\r\nInitial data\r\nTrap data\r\nLalehun was visited first, it took a couple of days to get up and running properly there so less trap nights were completed. 726 from Lalehun compared to 1120 from Seilama.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit no traps were set in houses, this will change for future visits.\r\n\r\nWe arrived late in Lalehun on the first day and were only able to set up one site, two further sites were set the next day with the final two up by the 2nd of December. We were more efficient by the time we got to Seilama with all but the village site set up on the first day. We were thus able to complete 4 nights of trapping at each site in Seilama.\r\nCatch data\r\nWe recorded the presence or absence of rodent bait the next morning, along with whether the trap was found to be sprung closed (i.e. it had been disturbed overnight or it had been triggered by a rodent but it had not successfully trapped it).\r\n\r\nThere appears to be a decrease in removal of bait from the traps in subsequent nights\r\n\r\n65 Rodents were trapped during the pilot study:\r\n22 in Lalehun for an overall trap success rate of 3%\r\n43 from Seilama for a trap success rate of 3.8%\r\nNo rodents were trapped in the distal agriculture or forested habitats at Lalehun, although it must be noted that only two nights of traps were set in those locations.\r\nLocation of trapped rodents\r\n48 (74%) of the trapped species belong to the family Muridae, the remaining 17 (26%) were shrews (family Soricidae).\r\n\r\nThe shrews (genera Crocidura) form the highest proportion of individuals. Praomys and Lophuromys were the most abundant Muridae genera. Praomys was not detected in Lalehun with Lophuromys being detected at both study sites. Mus and Lemniscomys were the only other Muridae caught in Lalehun. 6 additional genera of Muridae were trapped in Seilama above those caught in Lalehun.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t be over interpreted at the moment as more data will be needed but there is expected to be a difference in the habitat preferences of different species. This can also be looked at over time/seasonality.\r\n\r\nShrews were trapped in most locations but not within the forested/fallow areas.\r\nDiversity\r\n\r\nRichness was similar across all sites in Seilama, less so in Lalehun but likely related to the reduced trap nights obtained there.\r\n\r\nThere was some degree of increased abundance in the agricultural and fallow sites in Seilama compared to the village site. No rodents were trapped in site 4 and 5 in Lalehun so makes any comparisons slightly harder.\r\nWe will go on to calculate species diversity with for example the Shannon-Wiener index but I’d like to do some further work speciating the trapped rodents before this.\r\nSpecies ID\r\nI generated a taxanomic key for the small mammals likely to be trapped in the sites based on occurrence data from two sources. The first by Ara Monadjem et al. which had data on rodents and the second by Kingdon and Happold. These resources provided data that has been extracted into rodent_ids.R. The local team also had expertise in identifying rodents to species which was invaluable.\r\nThe field_id is based on their initial classification. I have then compared the measurements obtained in the field with the published measurements to corroborate their classification or suggest potential misclassification. All rodents were photographed and tissue samples were taken for chromosomal ID if required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This work used data extracted from the Electronic Healthcare Records of 657 in-patients. This work has been submitted for peer-review and publication. It is currently registered as a pre-print on medRxiv [@simons_association_2021] the publication is available here.\r\nI presented an interim analysis of this work at the 21st Annual SRNT-E Conference the recorded talk is available below.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nBackground It is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We examined i) the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory viral infections a year previous; and ii) concordance between smoking status recorded on the electronic health record (EHR) and the contemporaneous medical notes.\r\nMethods This case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, UK. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another respiratory virus a year previous). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered in April 2020 on the Open Science Framework.\r\nResults Current smokers had lower odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous (ORadj=0.55, 95% CI=0.31-0.96, p=.04). There was no significant association among former smokers (ORadj=1.08, 95% CI=0.72-1.65, p=.70). Smoking status recorded on the EHR (compared with the contemporaneous medical notes) was incorrectly recorded for 168 (79.6%) controls (χ2(3)=256.5, p=<0.001) and 60 cases (13.5%) (χ2(3)=34.2, p=<0.001).\r\nConclusions In a single UK hospital trust, current smokers had reduced odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous, although it is unclear whether this association is causal. Targeted post-discharge recording of smoking status may account for the greater EHR- medical notes concordance observed in cases compared with controls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There was little evidence on the effect of smoking or tobacco use (D. Simons, Perski, and Brown 2020). We performed a rapid review of the evidence at the request of the Royal College of Physicians, London (David Simons, Brown, et al. 2020). This work evolved into a living review.\r\nLiving review\r\nWe chose to synthesise the evidence through a Living Systematic Review due to the rapidly evolving information base. Searches were conducted monthly and we published our pre-print manuscripts on Qeios.
