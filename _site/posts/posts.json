Rodents typically demonstrate ‘fast’ life history strategies characterised by early maturation, short generation times, low juvenile and adult survival and high fecundity (Dobson and Oli 2007). There is a degree of between-species heterogeneity, with commensal species and those that are reservoirs of zoonoses having traits consistent with faster life histories (Han et al., 2015). Rodents often compete with humans for food produced in agricultural systems (Fiedler 1988), with 5-10% of rodent species classed as major pests. Commensal species thrive in human adapted landscapes nesting in houses and obtaining nutrition from human food storage and preparation areas. In sub-Saharan Africa, Mastomys spp. and Arvicanthis spp. are identified as causing a significant burden as agricultural pests (Stenseth et al. 2003). Crop loss within Afro-Malagasy small-holder farming communities is high, with 15% of pre-harvest crop being lost to rodent pest activity (Swanepoel et al. 2017).\r\nAnother important issue is the transmission of infectious diseases from rodents to humans. Zoonotic diseases (i.e. animal pathogens that impact human health) are transmitted via two pathways – a direct and an indirect pathway. The direct transmission pathway involves transmission of pathogens through rodents biting or scratching a human, or through contamination of food or water sources. The indirect pathway involves rodents acting as amplifying hosts for ectoparasites that themselves are vectors of zoonoses (Meerburg, Singleton, and Kijlstra 2009). Several rodent-borne pathogens are global in their distribution, including bacteria such as Lyme disease (caused by Borrelia burgdorferi) and Leptospirosis (caused by Leptospira spp.) and parasites such as Toxoplasmosis (caused by Toxoplasma gondii) and Leishmaniasis (caused by Leishmania spp.). However, most rodent-borne pathogens have more limited geographic distributions, particularly viral diseases such as Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (caused by Hantaviridae) concentrated in the Americas and Lassa fever (caused by Arenaviridae) limited to West Africa.\r\nGiven the significant economic and public health burden of rodents, monitoring rodent distributions is therefore an ongoing focus of research efforts across multiple scientific disciplines, including (but not limited to) conservation science, development studies and infectious disease epidemiology. The distribution of rodent populations can be monitored via rodent trapping efforts, with traps deployed in habitats expected to contain rodent species of interest.\r\nThere is increasing interest in the link between environmental and human factors and rodent populations to land use change and human population change. A recent review of studies included in the PREDICTS database (Hudson et al. 2014) identified that land use change from primary (i.e. intact forests) to managed and urban systems is associated with a change in rodent assemblages towards species that are more likely to be hosts of zoonoses (Gibb et al. 2020). Mastomys natalensis populations in Tanzania, East Africa are sensitive to seasonal meteorological cycles, in years with below average rainfall and short wet seasons population density is lower (Makundi, Massawe, and Mulungu 2007). Future climate change projections include longer and wetter West African monsoon seasons which could lead to increased zoonotic disease host rodent populations (Akinsanola and Zhou 2019). As West Africa contains several known rodent zoonotic reservoirs (e.g. Mastomys natalensis and Arvicanthus niloticus) and several potential reservoirs of zoonotic diseases (e.g. Lemniscomys striatus), this will be the geographic region of interest in this work.\r\nTo date there has been no comprehensive overview of rodent trapping studies conducted in West Africa. The aim of this scoping review is therefore to synthesise the knowledge on rodent distributions throughout West Africa obtained from trapping studies.\r\nWe specifically aim to address the following research questions :\r\nRQ1: In which West African countries or regions have rodent trapping studies been performed?\r\nRQ2: What are the stated aims of these rodent trapping studies?\r\nRQ3: Which rodent species are being targeted for trapping activities? Are species with high potential for hosting zoonotic pathogens targeted at higher rates?\r\nRQ4: How is the type of land use and/or land use intensity classified in the literature and are classifications comparable across studies?\r\nRQ5: Is rodent trapping occurring in all habitat types or are some habitats targeted at higher rates?\r\nRQ6: Is there an association of land use change, human population change or the implementation of regulatory strategies with rodent species distributions?\r\nMethods\r\nStudy design\r\nScoping review\r\nProtocol pre-registered on the Openscience Framework\r\nEligibility criteria\r\nStudies were included if:\r\nTrapping of small mammals including at least one species of Rodentia.\r\nDescriped trap used, length of trapping activity or location of trapping activity.\r\nIncluded trapping activity from at least one West African country: Benin, Burkina-Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo\r\nRecorded as outcome genus or species of trapped individual\r\nWere available in English\r\nPublished in a peer-reviewed journal, a pre-print manuscript or a report by a an identifiable organisation/consultancy\r\n\r\nStudies were excluded if:\r\nData were duplicated from a previously included study (i.e. secondary data analysis)\r\nNo full text were available\r\n\r\nSearch strategy\r\nThe following terms were searched for in OVID Medline, Web of Science (Core collection and Zoological Record), JSTOR, BioOne, African Journals Online, Global Health and the pre-print servers BioRxiv and EcoEvoRxiv:\r\nRodent\r\nWest Africa\r\nAND 2.\r\n\r\nOther resources including the UN Official Documents System, Open Grey, AGRIS FAO and Google Scholar were searched using combinations of the following terms:\r\nRodent\r\nRodent Trap*\r\nWest Africa\r\nAdditional articles were identified through references within included articles and reports known to the study team. Searches were completed on 2021-03-01.\r\nSelection of studies\r\nOne reviewer screened titles, abstracts and full texts against the inclusion criteria. A random subset of each of these (10%) were reviewed by a second reviewer.\r\nData extraction\r\nData were extracted by one reviewer. A second reviewer verified a subset (10%) of included studies. A data extraction form was maintained on a Google sheets document. Data extracted included i) study identifiers; ii) study aims; iii) trapping methodology; iv) geolocation data; v) method of speciation; vi) trapping locations and dates; vii) trapped species; viii) number of trap-nights and ix) microorganisms of interest.\r\nStudy aims\r\nWhere explicitly stated the study aims were extracted. For those with no recorded aims the specific aims were inferred from the background or conclusions of manuscript or report. The aims of the studies were broadly categorised as pertaining to rodent ecology research or studies on risk of zoonoses and further categorised into detailed aims.\r\nGeolocation of trapping activity\r\nGPS locations were extracted for the most precise location presented i.e. trap, trap-line, study-site or study region. Locations were extracted in the format reported and converted to decimal degrees. Where no GPS location is reported coordinates will be matched to study locations using the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency NGA GEOnet Names Server [ref.] based on study site name/region and through maps presented in the manuscript.\r\nTrapping methodology\r\nThe brand or description of the rodent trap was obtained from each study. For those using multiple devices all types were recorded. Type of trapping method. Effort of trapping\r\nHabitat classification\r\nGenus and species definitions\r\nClassification of species is variable over time as morphological and genetic information emerges. To handle species classification synonyms and reclassification the reported names of trapped species was compared to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility [ref.]. For species with updated taxonomies the synonym was converted to the accepted species name for all subsequent analyses. Where a subspecies is reported by study authors the species complex it belongs to will be used for subsequent analysis.\r\nPathogen testing\r\nResults\r\nA total of 4,282 records were identified, with 124 studies included in narrative synthesis (see Figure 1). The characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1. The earliest studies identified were from 1974 with the majority (61%) published since 2010. Most of the included studies were classified as rodent ecology research (56%) with the remainder of studies on zoonotic diseases (44%).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Flow diagram of records returned from the search strategy. Reasons for exclusion of studies at the full text stage are given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAims of included studies\r\nThe detailed aims of the included studies are shown in Figure 2. Biodiversity of rodents was a shared aim between the two themes with 37 ecological studies and 2 zoonoses studies investigating this. The remaining aims were more disparate with ecological studies investigating rodent population dynamics, rodent species assemblages, the genetics of rodents and their behaviours. Most zoonotic disease research focussed on prevalence of pathogens in rodent populations, the risk of spillover to human populations, the identity of pathogen reservoir species with fewer studies investigating the phylogenetics of pathogen strains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: The aims of included studies following division into ecological and zoonotic infectious disease themes. Multiple aims were identified from each study, the number on the arrow indicates the number of distinct studies with that aim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation of studies\r\nThe included studies trapped in 17 countries, however, three countries were outside of the scope of this study (Cameroon, Chad and Morocco). At least a single trap site was recorded from 14 West African countries, with no rodent trapping reported from Gambia or Togo.\r\nMost studies (93%) were conducted in a single country, five studies were conducted in two countries, three studies were conducted in five countries and one study was conducted across six countries. This lead to 146 trapping activities being reported across the 14 West African countries. More trapping activity was reported from Senegal (19%) than any other country. Nigeria (13%), Ghana and Guinea (both 12%) were the next most frequently trapped countries, followed by Mali and Benin (both 8%), Niger and Sierra Leone (both 6%), Mauritania and the Ivory Coast (4%), Burkina Faso (3%), Liberia (2%) with Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde recording a single trapping activity.\r\nThe trapping activity from the included studies was spread across 1,193 study sites. Thirty-one (25%) studies reported trapping only occurring at a single study site, 45 (37%) studies trapped at between two and five study sites the remaining 48 studies trapped at between six and 93 study sites. Trap sites were mapped to level two country administrative regions and density of sites per million square kilometers was calculated (see Figure 3). The areas with highest trapping densities included the capital cities of Niger, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Benin, Mali, Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Of the areas not incorporating capital cities Northern Senegal (Fatique, Thies, Saint-Louis and Kedougou), Southern Guinea (Kindia and Nzerejore), Edo and Osun States in Nigeria and Eastern Sierra Leone were most intensively studied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Density of trap sites per thousand km2\r\n\r\n\r\nTrap types\r\nOf the included studies 18 did not state the type of trap used with three studies reporting supplementary hand trapping of rodents alongside trap use. For the remaining studies three used more than four types of rodent traps, twelve used three types, 33 used two types the remaining 58 studies used a single trap type. The most commonly used trap was the Sherman trap (56%) which is available in several sizes, locally made wire mesh traps were used in 35 studies (28%), less commonly used trap types included the Museum special, Tomahawk, Victor, Snaptraps and Firobind traps.\r\nTrap setup within the study area\r\nForty studies did not describe the structure of the trap setup within the defined study area. Twenty seven studies placed transect lines of traps through study sites with nineteen studies placing traps along a line but not clearly describing a transect across a defined site. Twenty-two studies purposefully sampled houses, with nine further studies purposefully placing traps in targeted locations (i.e. near rivers, in fields, by houses). Ten studies placed traps in a structured grid across a single or multiple specified habitat types. Three studies described a stratified or randomised approach to placing traps within a defined area. Trap setup was commonly reported in ecology studies (81%) with transect lines the most commonly used approach. Trap setup was reported in 56% of zoonoses risk studies with purposeful placement of traps in houses the most common approach (24%).\r\nTrapping effort\r\nTrapping effort was variably reported across included studies. Thirty-nine studies did not report any measures of trapping effort. Forty-two studies reported a measure of trapping effort at the same level of detail at which they reported rodent captures (the unit of analysis) and were classified as complete reports. Thirty-nine studies had incomplete reports on trapping effort due to not presenting the number of trap nights at the appropriate unit of analysis (i.e. number of study nights only or total number of trap-nights). Trapping effort was more completely reported from ecology studies (51% complete information and 21% no information) compared to zoonoses risk studies (11% complete information and 44% no information).\r\nAmong studies that reported complete trap-night information the median number of trap-nights per study was 4,418 (Interquartile range (IQR) = 1,187-10,252) with a minimum of 240 trap-nights and maximum of 45,274 trap-nights. For studies reporting the number of trap-nights at the unit of analysis (typically study site or habitat type) the median number of trap-nights at each site was 360 (IQR = 246-793). In studies with incomplete reports on trap-nights there was a median of 7,200 trap-nights (IQR = 1,184-9,424) conducted, for 26 studies reporting only on the number of days or nights trapping was performed on activities typically lasted between 1-4 nights.\r\nHabitat classification\r\nNo studies reported trap habitats with direct reference to a habitat classification scheme. Thirteen studies did not describe the local habitat where traps were placed (4 ecology, 9 zoonoses). The remaining studies used more than 170 descriptions of the habitat type in which trapping was conducted, further, the resolution of the description varied between studies with some reporting the habitat of the location of the trap and others the study site or region. The reported habitat types were combined into 30 categories (see Supplementary table 2 for the habitat dictionary) for further analysis. At least one habitat was recorded for 17,122 trap sites (95%), with two or more habitats for a single trap site recorded for 4,403 (24%) sites. Single trap sites could span multiple habitat types resulting in 22,202 habitat or trap sites. The most commonly trapped sites were in or around buildings (29%), in areas described as the rodents “natural habitat” (24%), in agricultural areas (13%) (e.g. rice fields, palm plantations), forests (8%) and in the area surrounding buildings (4%).\r\nHabitat type was more comprehensively reported from ecology studies, 30 habitat categories were reported from ecology studies with the most commonly investigated habitats being agriculture (23%), within forests (18%) and in or around buildings (16%). Among studies on zoonoses 15 habitat categories were reported, the most commonly reported classification was described as the rodents “natural habitat” (39%), within or around buildings (38%) and in agricultural settings (7%).\r\nSpecies identification\r\nThirteen included studies did not describe the method used to identify trapped rodents. Most studies (52%) relied solely on morphometric identification against taxonomic keys or museum voucher specimens. Nine studies described molecular identification of rodents with 30% using a combination of morphological and molecular techniques. In more recently published studies (since 2010) 76% used molecular techniques to assist with speciation, compared with less than 15% in studies published before 2010.\r\nReported species and species abundance\r\nAcross all West African study sites there were 73,164 trapped small mammals (592 were trapped outside of West African countries), 2,830 (4%) trapped individuals were identified to order level (Rodentia), 7,760 (11%) were identified to genus level, the remaining 62,574 (85%) were identified to species level. Of the 147 distinct identified species trapped (see Supplementary table 1) the majority were from the order Rodentia (112) with Muridae (82) being the largest family of rodents, Sciuridae (10), followed by Gliridae and Nesomyidae (both 6), Ctenodactylidae and Anomaluridae (2) and Dipodidae, Hystricidae and Thryonomidae (all 1). The remaining 34 species came from the orders of the Soricomorpha (31), Erinaceomorpha (2) and Afrosoricida (1).\r\nA similar number of rodents were trapped for ecology studies (36,367) as for studies investigating the risk of zoonoses (36,205). Animals trapped as part of ecological research were more often identified to species level (90%) than those trapped in zoonoses research (82%). The most commonly trapped genera of rodents were Mastomys sp. (27,072, 38.5%), Rattus sp. (10,191, 14.5%), Mus sp. (8,624, 12.3%), Arvicanthis sp. (5,821, 8.3%) and Praomys sp. (5,409, 7.7%). At the species level Mastomys natalensis (11,221, 17.9%) and Rattus rattus (8,578, 13.7%) were the most commonly trapped rodents, Mastomys erythroleucus (8,578, 13.7%), Mus musculus (6,245, 8.8%), Arvicanthis niloticus (5,497, 8.8%) and Mastomys huberti (4,699, 7.5%) made up the next most commonly trapped species. Presence and absence maps for these six most commonly trapped species are shown in Figure 4.\r\nTrap success rates\r\nRodent biodiversity\r\nDiversity indices, accumulation measures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Presence and absence of the 6 most commonly trapped species in included studies, no adjustment made for trapping effort\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPathogens\r\nX studies presented data on microorganisms that infect or are carried by small mammal species in West Africa. Data from a study previously excluded (Fichet-Calvet et al. 2007) due to duplicated data was incorporated as it provided the complementary pathogen data to the rodent trapping data. X of the studies were solely investigated pathogens of rodents. The remaining X studies investigated organisms that were potentially zoonotic pathogens, pathogens of rodents or microbial organisms that were of uncertain significance to rodent or human health.\r\nX studies used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of X different species or families of microorganisms. X studies used antibody or antigen based molecular tests to detect the presence of 9 different species or families of microorganisms. X studies conducted histological or direct visualisation assays of samples for X parasitic or bacterial species. X studies performed direct viral culture of Lassa mammarenavirus to detect the presence of the virus in rodent specimens.\r\nThe rodent pathogens investigated were Hydatigera species (previously Taenia species) and Trichuris species both of which are gastro-intestinal helminths and Leishmania major which is an intracellular pathogen causing disease in both rodents and humans.\r\nX of the X studies reported prevalence of zoonotic pathogens at a level of detail beyond a study wide summary. These studies typically tested for a single pathogen (X), with X studies testing for two and three pathogens and X studies testing for five or more. The most frequently tested for pathogens were Lassa mammarenavirus (X) or members of the Arenaviridae family (X), the spirochete bacteria Borrelia was investigated in X studies, Bartonella and Toxoplasma gondii were investigated in X each, the remaining X pathogens were reported in two or fewer studies.\r\nX of the studies reporting data on pathogen prevalence had incomplete data on the geolocation from which some of the animals tested were from. X of these studies had no data on geolocation of the trapped rodents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Presence and absence of the 4 most commonly tested for species in included studies, no adjustment made

This data has been used to support study site selection.\r\nPreviously documented Lassa cases in Sierra Leone\r\n\r\n\r\nThis highlights that most of the documented cases of Lassa Fever in Sierra Leone are found in the East of the country. There is a particularly large cluster around Kenema, the location of the Lassa Fever treatment ward and reference laboratory. There is a slightly smaller cluster to the North and North East of the city around Panguma and Segbwema. recently cases have been detected near Freetown and Bo suggesting a wider distribution. Several projects over the last couple of years, PREDICTS and LAROCS have been conducting larger transect studies across the country which while not formally reported are suggestive of widespread serological evidence of infection in rodents.\r\nMy work will be focussed primarily around Panguma, I will set up a “control” site in Kambia and I would also like to set up an additional semi-urban site on the outskirts of either Panguma or Kenema to complement the two rural sites I will describe below.\r\n The above map highlights human cases and positive rodents in and around Panguma. This in combination with land use maps was used to select the two rural sites. Lalehun lies to the East of Panguma. Seilama lies to the South West. Both are represented by a black diamond.\r\nLand use at the study sites\r\nTo address the above questions it’s important to sample rodents in several distinct habitats. If these habitats undergo changed use during the observed study period this would provide additional causal evidence for any changes in rodent assemblage species composition. However, this is not a specific requirement for this work. Observed differences between species composition across different land usages remains illustrative.\r\nThis land use classification is obtained from a recent paper by Jung et al. 2020. The colours represent different IUCN habitat classifications\r\nBlack = 14.5 Urban Areas\r\nOrange = 3.6 Shrubland - Subtropical-tropical moist\r\nRed = 14.3 Plantations\r\nLight green = 1.6 Forest - subtropical-tropical moist lowland\r\nDark green = 1.9 Forest - subtropical-tropical moist montane\r\nMauve = 3.7 Shrubland - subtropical-tropical high altitude\r\nLalehun land use map, classified by IUCN categoriesSeilama land use map, classified by IUCN categoriesUsing the habitat map and discussions with locals we identified sites that would provide use with varied habitats and that would also be able to be repeatedly sampled irrespective of whether the visit was conducted during the rainy season.\r\nLalehun (Village 1) trap grid locations\r\n The base map used here is from Google maps and so is unfortunately not entirely up-to-date.\r\nThe habitats of the trap grids are as follows:\r\n1 - Village periphery\r\n2 - Proximal agriculture (wet rice field)\r\n3a - Developing Banana plantation and fallow land\r\n3b - Developing Banana plantation and Pineapple garden\r\n4 - Disturbed forest, long-term (5 years) fallow land\r\n5 - Cassava plantation\r\n6 - Within the village, outside of houses\r\nThe specific location of each individual trap was also recorded (e.g. edge environment, base of tree)\r\nSeilama (Village 1) trap grid locations\r\n The habitats of the trap grids are as follows:\r\n1 - Palm plantation, near the village and main road\r\n2 - Proximal agriculture (Cacao and Coffee plantation)\r\n3 - Recently harvested dry rice field\r\n4 - Cassava plantation\r\n5 - Disturbed forest, long term fallow\r\n6 - Within the village, outside of houses\r\nThis effectively produces 1 trap site in the village, 3 proximal agricultural sites, 1 distal agriculture and 1 forest/fallow land site for each village site.\r\nThe code to produce the maps of trap location is in scripts/geolocation_traps.R with the data available in data/trap_sites.csv\r\nInitial data\r\nTrap data\r\nLalehun was visited first, it took a couple of days to get up and running properly there so less trap nights were completed. 726 from Lalehun compared to 1120 from Seilama.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit no traps were set in houses, this will change for future visits.\r\n\r\nWe arrived late in Lalehun on the first day and were only able to set up one site, two further sites were set the next day with the final two up by the 2nd of December. We were more efficient by the time we got to Seilama with all but the village site set up on the first day. We were thus able to complete 4 nights of trapping at each site in Seilama.\r\nCatch data\r\nWe recorded the presence or absence of rodent bait the next morning, along with whether the trap was found to be sprung closed (i.e. it had been disturbed overnight or it had been triggered by a rodent but it had not successfully trapped it).\r\n\r\nThere appears to be a decrease in removal of bait from the traps in subsequent nights\r\n\r\n65 Rodents were trapped during the pilot study:\r\n22 in Lalehun for an overall trap success rate of 3%\r\n43 from Seilama for a trap success rate of 3.8%\r\nNo rodents were trapped in the distal agriculture or forested habitats at Lalehun, although it must be noted that only two nights of traps were set in those locations.\r\nLocation of trapped rodents\r\n48 (74%) of the trapped species belong to the family Muridae, the remaining 17 (26%) were shrews (family Soricidae).\r\n\r\nThe shrews (genera Crocidura) form the highest proportion of individuals. Praomys and Lophuromys were the most abundant Muridae genera. Praomys was not detected in Lalehun with Lophuromys being detected at both study sites. Mus and Lemniscomys were the only other Muridae caught in Lalehun. 6 additional genera of Muridae were trapped in Seilama above those caught in Lalehun.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t be over interpreted at the moment as more data will be needed but there is expected to be a difference in the habitat preferences of different species. This can also be looked at over time/seasonality.\r\n\r\nShrews were trapped in most locations but not within the forested/fallow areas.\r\nDiversity\r\n\r\nRichness was similar across all sites in Seilama, less so in Lalehun but likely related to the reduced trap nights obtained there.\r\n\r\nThere was some degree of increased abundance in the agricultural and fallow sites in Seilama compared to the village site. No rodents were trapped in site 4 and 5 in Lalehun so makes any comparisons slightly harder.\r\nWe will go on to calculate species diversity with for example the Shannon-Wiener index but I’d like to do some further work speciating the trapped rodents before this.\r\nSpecies ID\r\nI generated a taxanomic key for the small mammals likely to be trapped in the sites based on occurrence data from two sources. The first by Ara Monadjem et al. which had data on rodents and the second by Kingdon and Happold. These resources provided data that has been extracted into rodent_ids.R. The local team also had expertise in identifying rodents to species which was invaluable.\r\nThe field_id is based on their initial classification. I have then compared the measurements obtained in the field with the published measurements to corroborate their classification or suggest potential misclassification. All rodents were photographed and tissue samples were taken for chromosomal ID if required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This work used data extracted from the Electronic Healthcare Records of 657 in-patients. This work has been submitted for peer-review and publication. It is currently registered as a pre-print on medRxiv (Simons et al. 2021) the publication is available here.\r\nI presented an interim analysis of this work at the 21st Annual SRNT-E Conference the recorded talk is available below.\r\nAbstract\r\nBackground It is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We examined i) the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory viral infections a year previous; and ii) concordance between smoking status recorded on the electronic health record (EHR) and the contemporaneous medical notes.\r\nMethods This case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, UK. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another respiratory virus a year previous). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered in April 2020 on the Open Science Framework.\r\nResults Current smokers had lower odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous (ORadj=0.55, 95% CI=0.31-0.96, p=.04). There was no significant association among former smokers (ORadj=1.08, 95% CI=0.72-1.65, p=.70). Smoking status recorded on the EHR (compared with the contemporaneous medical notes) was incorrectly recorded for 168 (79.6%) controls (χ2(3)=256.5, p=<0.001) and 60 cases (13.5%) (χ2(3)=34.2, p=<0.001).\r\nConclusions In a single UK hospital trust, current smokers had reduced odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous, although it is unclear whether this association is causal. Targeted post-discharge recording of smoking status may account for the greater EHR- medical notes concordance observed in cases compared with controls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimons, David, Olga Perski, Lion Shahab, Jamie Brown, and Robin Bailey. 2021. “The Association of Smoking Status with Hospitalisation for COVID-19 Compared with Other Respiratory Viruses a Year Previous: A Case-Control Study at a Single UK National Health Service Trust.” medRxiv, March, 2020.11.26.20238469. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.26.20238469.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There was little evidence on the effect of smoking or tobacco use (D. Simons, Perski, and Brown 2020). We performed a rapid review of the evidence at the request of the Royal College of Physicians, London (David Simons, Brown, et al. 2020). This work evolved into a living review.\r\nLiving review\r\nWe chose to synthesise the evidence through a Living Systematic Review due to the rapidly evolving information base. Searches were conducted monthly and we published our pre-print manuscripts on Qeios.
